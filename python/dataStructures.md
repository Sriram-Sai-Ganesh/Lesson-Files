# Data Structures in Python
Python's built in data-structures are
* Lists
* Dictionaries
* Sets
* Tuples

## Lists
Lists are created using square brackets
```
my_list = [0, 3, 1, 2]
```
If you are familiar with other languages, you may call this an array. 
However, Python lists are different from arrays because their length can change and they can hold data of different types.

To get an item from a list, place square brackets with the index of the element you want to select like so:
```
my_list[1] # will return 3
```

## Dictionaries
Dictionaries are created with curly brackets
```
my_dict = {"key": "value"}
```
This data structure is similar to what other languages would call a map or hashmap.
To add an item to a dictionary, you can use the format
```
my_dict[key] = value;
```
