# Lesson-Files
Here you will find resources to help you get started with Competitive Programming. Created by the Competitive Programming Club at Ohio State.

## Getting Started
These guides assume that you already know the basics of how to write code. If you don't, you can find many basic tutorials free online. Python is the easiest to learn with short and easy to understand code, but if you are at Ohio State, you might want to learn Java as it is the language used in most courses. Guides for Python, Java, and C++ are provided in the folders of this repository.

## Languages
* Python - Easiest lanuage to learn. Short and readable code. Runs slower than the other languages but is still suitable for competitive programming.
* Java - Language taught at Ohio State. Faster than Python but less readable.
* C++ - The preferred language of most competitive programmers. Runs fast but difficult for beginners.

### Environment
You can write code in whatever environment you want, although the most popular are VSCode, Eclipse, and Vim.
